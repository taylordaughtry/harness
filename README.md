# Harness

**A featherweight framework that seeks to make modern development more accessible.**

Harness is built for the modern web. Older browsers have gone, and most modern browsers are relatively good at supporting javascript interactions. As a result, developers are working with javascript frameworks that have hundreds of lines of workarounds for situations that will likely never happen today. Enter: Harness.

Harness is built as a thin wrapper around vanilla javascript, abstracting away the most common frustrations of javascript, while still keeping the developer as close as possible to native code. Building it this way keeps Harness quick, effective, and out-of-the-way, so you can simply work.

## TL;DR
 - Will always be under `10KB` minified
 - Complete documentation on all methods
 - Straightforward internals
 - IE 10 and later
 - Built on Gulp

## Performance

Harness core minifies to `2KB`, and includes support for IE 10 and later. It's purpose-built to be as fast as possible, while still providing quick wins to make working with javascript a bit easier.

## Browser Support

Harness supports modern browsers, including IE 10 or later. If you're looking for earlier support, watch/star this repo to be notified when the Legacy branch for older browsers is released.

## Usage

For specific usage information, see the [Official Harness Wiki](https://github.com/taylordaughtry/harness/wiki).
